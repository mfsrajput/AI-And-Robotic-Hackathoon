# Prompt

Generate Module 2 (4 chapters): The Digital Twin.

100% Constitution-compliant (objectives, dual-track, active learning, worked examples, tiered assessments, Mermaid, inclusive examples).

Topics:
1. Gazebo Physics & World Building
2. Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)
3. Unity for High-Fidelity HRI
4. Creating Complete Digital Twins

Include Gazebo SDF, sensor plugins, Unity-ROS TCP bridge examples.

Output only file contents. Execute now.

# Response

I have successfully created Module 2 of the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with 4 comprehensive chapters on Digital Twins:

1. `docs/02-digital-twin/01-gazebo-physics-and-world-building.md` - Covers Gazebo physics simulation and world building
2. `docs/02-digital-twin/02-simulating-sensors-lidar-imu-depth.md` - Details sensor simulation for LiDAR, IMU, and depth cameras
3. `docs/02-digital-twin/03-unity-for-high-fidelity-hri.md` - Explains Unity integration for high-fidelity human-robot interaction
4. `docs/02-digital-twin/04-creating-complete-digital-twins.md` - Shows how to create complete integrated digital twin systems

Each chapter follows the Constitution's 10 pedagogical principles and includes:
- 3-7 learning objectives
- Theory ↔ Practice dual-track content
- Active learning exercises
- Worked examples with black-box to glass-box explanations
- Tiered assessments (3 levels)
- Mermaid diagrams with alt-text
- 6-8 academic citations per chapter

I also created:
- `docs/02-digital-twin/_category_.json` - Category configuration for the documentation system

The content includes practical examples with Gazebo SDF files, sensor plugins, Unity-ROS TCP bridge implementations, and complete digital twin system architectures as specified.
