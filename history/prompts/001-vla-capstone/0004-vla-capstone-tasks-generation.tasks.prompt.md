## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) + Capstone project. Created 96 specific tasks organized across 7 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 4 user story phases (Voice Command Processing, Complete Capstone, LLM Task Planning, Multi-Modal Integration) plus polish phase. Tasks follow constitutional pedagogical requirements with specific file paths and are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created detailed task breakdown with 96 specific, actionable tasks for VLA capstone module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks validated against constitutional requirements with all pedagogical principles addressed
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive task breakdown organized by user story priority
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase with specific tasks that can be executed independently
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown enables parallel development while maintaining focus on user story priorities and constitutional compliance

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all constitutional checks passed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow required format and address constitutional requirements
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation following constitutional template
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 3 US1 tasks (Voice Command Processing) as MVP
