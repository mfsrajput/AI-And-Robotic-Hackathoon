# Prompt

Generate Module 4 (4 chapters): Vision-Language-Action + Full Capstone Project.

100% Constitution-compliant.

Topics:
1. Voice-to-Action using OpenAI Whisper
2. LLM Task & Motion Planning (natural language → ROS actions)
3. Multi-Modal Integration (vision + language + action)
4. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid (full end-to-end system)

Include complete VLA pipeline, ROS 2 action servers, LLM prompt templates, final project rubric.

Output only file contents. Execute now.

# Response

I have successfully created Module 4 of the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with 4 comprehensive chapters on Vision-Language-Action systems:

1. `docs/04-vla/01-voice-to-action-with-whisper.md` - Covers voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper
2. `docs/04-vla/02-llm-task-and-motion-planning.md` - Details LLM-based task and motion planning
3. `docs/04-vla/03-multi-modal-integration.md` - Explains multi-modal integration (vision + language + action)
4. `docs/04-vla/04-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md` - Complete capstone project with autonomous humanoid system

Each chapter follows the Constitution's 10 pedagogical principles and includes:
- 3-7 learning objectives
- Theory ↔ Practice dual-track content
- Active learning exercises
- Worked examples with black-box to glass-box explanations
- Tiered assessments (3 levels)
- Mermaid diagrams with alt-text
- 6-8 academic citations per chapter

I also created:
- `docs/04-vla/_category_.json` - Category configuration for the documentation system

The content includes practical examples with complete VLA pipeline implementation, ROS 2 action servers, LLM prompt templates, and a comprehensive capstone project rubric as specified.
