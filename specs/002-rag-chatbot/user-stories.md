# User Stories for Integrated RAG Chatbot

1. **As a student**, I can open a floating chatbot and ask questions about any part of the book so I get accurate explanations.

2. **As a student**, I can highlight text in a chapter and click "Ask about this" to get an explanation based only on that selection + relevant context.

3. **As a reader**, I see inline source citations (chapter links) in every answer.

4. **As a maintainer**, I can run a script to re-ingest updated book content into the vector database.
