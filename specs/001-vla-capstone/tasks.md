# DEPRECATED: Tasks for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) + Capstone

**STATUS: ARCHIVED** These tasks have been superseded by the Integrated RAG Chatbot implementation.

**Original Feature**: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) + Capstone | **Superseded by**: [specs/002-rag-chatbot/tasks.md](specs/002-rag-chatbot/tasks.md)

## Summary

These tasks for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) + Capstone module have been archived. The project direction was pivoted to implement the Integrated RAG Chatbot feature instead, which better aligned with the immediate needs for an interactive textbook experience.

The actual implemented tasks are documented in specs/002-rag-chatbot/tasks.md and include:
- Backend setup & ingestion from live site URLs
- Cohere embeddings (embed-english-v3.0) + generation (command-r-08-2024)
- /query endpoint with selected_text priority
- Floating chatbot UI
- Text selection detection & "Ask about this"
- Streaming responses with source citations
- Constitution compliance (no hallucinations, privacy, accuracy)

## Original Task Status (Deprecated)

The following tasks were planned but not completed as the project pivoted to the RAG Chatbot:

- T019-T143: All remaining VLA tasks were incomplete
- Only foundational tasks (T001-T018) and some initial work (T020-T041, T044, T045, T048, T049, T058, T062-T069, T070, T071, T080, T083) were marked as completed

## Decision

The project team decided to pivot from the VLA module to implement the Integrated RAG Chatbot feature to provide immediate value to textbook users through an interactive Q&A system. The RAG Chatbot better serves the core mission of enhancing the educational experience with AI-powered assistance.
